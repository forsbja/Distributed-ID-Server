Comments:
Great work, guys! I really like the scaling you've implemented, and the UI looks intuitive
and easy to navigate what's going on. I really like that it pretty much instantly reacts
to new servers being spun up. It's also good that you implemented a stateless server, that 
makes scaling much easier :)
